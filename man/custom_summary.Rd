\title{custom_summary() function}
\usage{
custom_summary(x, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector containing the data for which summary statistics are to be calculated.
The name \code{x} is chosen as it is standard in statistical functions to represent input data.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether \code{NA} values should be removed before computation.
\code{na.rm} is used to be consistent with other R functions, like \code{mean()}, which also use \code{na.rm} to handle missing values.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed if needed to \code{mean()}, \code{median()}, or \code{sd()}.
We use \code{...} to give flexibility for other parameters like \code{trim} for \code{mean()} or other arguments specific to each function which the user would like to use.}
}
\value{
A list containing three elements: \code{mean}, \code{median}, and \code{sd}, which represent the mean, median, and standard deviation of the input vector, respectively.
This output format is chosen for consistency, as lists can store multiple summary statistics with named elements.
}
\description{
Calculates customized summary statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation) for a numeric vector.
}
\examples{
# Basic usage with a numeric vector
custom_summary(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

# Handling NA values by setting na.rm = TRUE
custom_summary(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5), na.rm = TRUE)

# Passing additional arguments (e.g., using trim for mean)
custom_summary(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), na.rm = TRUE, trim = 0.1)
}
